# how to control the work that gets done
# possible values are:
# - scrape - read the headers, write out the xml - kind of a test mode
# - store - calls cadc-data to put a file from local storage (use_local_files must be set to True)
# - ingest - read the headers, write the xml to the endpoint found by resource_id
# - modify - create a footprint and previews for an existing CAOM model record
#
# these combinations have been tested:
# scrape => with use_local_files set to True
# scrape, modify => with use_local_files set to True, will not write to service
#
# store, ingest, modify => with use_local_files set to True
# ingest, modify => with use_local_files set to True
#
# ingest, modify => with use_local_files set to False
